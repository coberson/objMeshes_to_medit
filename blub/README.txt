--------------------------------------------
This archive contains a description of the surface “Blub,” including:

1. the original Catmull-Clark control mesh [blub_control_mesh.obj]

Following files can be obtained from the original archive:

2. the original texture map as a vector image [blub_texture.pdf]
3. triangular and quadrilateral tessellations [blub_triangulated.obj, blub_quadrangulated.obj]
4. the texture map as a raster image [blub_texture.png]

Meshes are stored in the Wavefront OBJ format.  All meshes
are manifold, genus-0 embeddings.  The texture map should be interpreted as a
unit square in the positive quadrant [0,1]x[0,1].
